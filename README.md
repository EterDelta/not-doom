# Not Doom


![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C-9C869B.svg?style=flat-square)

A personal fork of Chocolate Doom. Its only purpose is adding a bunch of random stuff and playing with the engine.

Most things you can find here are showcased in my channel.

## Current Features

- **Creeper**: A new enemy type inspired by Minecraft's iconic mob, mimicking their behavior and aspect. 
- **Creepers Difficulty**: A custom skill setting based on Nightmare where common enemies have a chance to spawn as creepers.

## Installation

The easiest way to test this is to download a build from the Releases page, it comes along with the project WAD and dependencies.

You'll launch the game using the `merge` option Chocolate Doom provides.

```bash
not-doom.exe -merge not-doom.wad
```
Remember you'll also need to obtain a legitimate copy of DOOM's WAD file. Place it in the same folder as the executable.

If you prefer, you can always build from scratch following one of the [Chocolate Doom Tutorials](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Building_Chocolate_Doom_on_Windows_(alternative_build)).
